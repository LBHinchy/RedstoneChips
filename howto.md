Building a Chip
---------------
- Start by building the chip's __structure__ out of any block you want. You can't use sand or gravel and the block type must be different than the input/output/interface blocks type (see below).
- Place a __wall sign__ attached to one of the chip blocks. This is the starting point of the circuit and affects the order of input and output pins. Set the sign text according to the circuit you're trying to build. See the [circuitdocs](/RedstoneChips/circuitdocs) for more info.
- Add __output blocks__ (gold block by default) and __input blocks__ (iron block by default). Each block has to be attached to a chip block. Changes in redstone current will be sensed on any side or on top of the input blocks. 
- The circuit outputs its bits by setting levers on and off. Attach __levers__ to any side or on top of each output block.
- Some circuits, such as the [synth](/RedstoneChips/circuitdocs/Synth.html) circuit require you to add __interface blocks__ (lapis blocks by default). Again, make sure that each interface block is attached to a chip block. The circuit will then use blocks on any side, on top, or below as a point of interaction with the "physical" world or the player. In the case of the synth circuit, it will play a note on any noteblock attached to its interface blocks.
- Last but not least, go back to your circuit sign and __left-click__ it to activate the circuit. If all went well, you should receive a message saying 'Circuit X activated: > a input(s), b output(s), and c interface block(s)'. 

The order of your input and output blocks is very important as different pin numbers have different functions. In simple circuit structures the pin numbering starts at the chip sign onwards. See "Chip detection scanning rules" below, for information on predicting the order of pins in more complex structures.

If you're having problems or just want to see more information, you can use the debugging commands `/rcdebug`, `/rcinfo` and `/rcpin`. See the description below.


Simple [adder](/RedstoneChips/circuitdocs/Adder.html) circuit. Input and output 0 lies next to the circuit sign.

Plugin commands
----------------

###`/rclist` - Prints a list of active chips.

usage: `/rclist [world-name|all|this] [<filter-type>: <arg>,<arg>,<arg>;â€¦]`

The command without any arguments will list all circuits in the current world or, when used from the server console, circuits
in all worlds.

Use `/rclist` all as a player to see a list of all circuits on the server
Use `/rclist <world-name>` to list all circuits in a specific world.

To show only specific kind of circuits you can use a filter. There are several filter types.
`location: <x>,<y>,<z>,[radius]` - Show only circuits in a radius around the location.
`location: this, [radius]` - Uses your current location.
`chunk: <x>,<z>` - Show only circuits in the specified chunk. `chunk: this` will use your current chunk
`class: <class-name>` - Show only circuits of the specified class. You can use partial class names.
You can combine different filters by separating them with a semicolon (;). You can also use partial filter type names.

Examples:
  `/rclist this ch: this; cl: pix` - List every pixel circuit in your current world and chunk.
  `/rclist this loc: this, 10; class: decoder` - List every decoder in a 10 block radius around you.

###`/rcclasses` - Prints a list of installed circuit classes.

usage: `/rcclasses`
***

###`/rcarg` - Replace, add or clear circuit sign arguments.

usage: `/rcarg <arg-number|add|clear> <arg-value>...<arg-number|add|clear> <arg-value>`

Use by pointing at the circuit you want to edit and execute the command. To change an existing argument value use `/rcarg <arg-number> <arg-value>`, 
where arg-number is the sign argument number, starting to count with 1 and arg-value is the new value for this argument.

To add an argument as the last argument use `/rcarg add <arg-value>`.
To remove an argument use `/rcarg clear <arg-number>`

You can make changes to more than 1 argument by typing additional command arguments, for ex. `/rcarg 1 val clear 2`
will set the 1st argument to val and remove the 2nd argument.
***

Destroying a Chip
-----------------
You can destroy a chip by breaking any of its structure blocks, including the output levers or by running the /redchips-deactivate command
while pointing at a circuit block. Use `/redchips-destroy` to destroy the chip and remove all of its blocks. 
__Creepers__, __TNT__ explosions and __fire__ (in case you're using flammable blocks) will also cause the IC to stop functioning.
__Power tools__, however, will not cause it to decativate and can result in "phantom" circuits still taking place in memory without an actual chip to make them of any use.
When the plugin saves it's circuits states it will deactivate any circuit that any of it's blocks were broken.

Chip detection scanning rules (for the advanced RC user...)
------------------------------
To be able to guess the pin numbering of more complex structures you need to understand how the plugin detects and scans the structure once you activate it by clicking on the sign. It scans the circuit block by block starting at the sign block itself. The pins are numbered as the circuit structure is scanned, therefore when the structure is a straight line the count starts at the sign and onwards. When more than one dimension is used the plugin will scan according to the following rules:
1. The sign block is added to the structure and then the plugin moves to the chip block the sign is attached to. 
2. It will try to find input, output or interface blocks at any of the other sides of the chip block and above or below. The important part is the order in which different sides are scanned. First, it will look to the right (relative to the current scan direction), next it will look to the left. After that it will look at the next block in the original direction and finally it will look back, opposite to the scan direction. Finally it checks the block above and below. If going backwards seem like a waste of time see the next point. 
3. Now the plugin will go to the next chip block. The scan order is 
	1. The block to the right, relative to the current scan direction.
	2. The block to the left, relative to the current scan direction.
	3. The block in the same direction as before.
	4. The block in the opposite direction.
	5. One block up. If the block above is a chip block the scan will continue in the same direction as before only one level above.
	6. One block below. Will also continue in the same direction.
	
One very important thing to note is that the recursive scanning process work by branches. It will continue going from block to block in one direction even when chip blocks are found in other directions. Only when it reaches a dead end it will go back to try the other branches.

The exact algorithm can be found at the [CircuitManager](http://github.com/eisental/RedstoneChips/blob/master/src/main/java/org/tal/redstonechips/CircuitManager.java) class. Specifically `CircuitManager.checkForCircuit()`
