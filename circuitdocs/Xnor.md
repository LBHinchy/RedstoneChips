title: nor gate
---

An XNOR gate with any number of bit sets. Each bit set can be of any size.

[source code](https://github.com/eisental/BasicCircuits/blob/master/src/main/java/org/tal/basiccircuits/xnor.java)

For a detailed example of building a chip that uses a variable number of input bit sets read the [AND gate documentation](And).

#### I/O setup 
* Can have any number of outputs. The number of output pins determines the number of bits in each input bit set.  
* The number of input pins can be any multiple of the number of outputs.

#### Sign text
1. `   xnor   `
