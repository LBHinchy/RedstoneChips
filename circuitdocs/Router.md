Routes any input signal into one or more outputs according to the routing table.
The routing table should be written on the sign using the following syntax: ` <input pin>:<output pin> ` any number of table entries 
can be used. 

Here's an example routing table for a 2 inputs, 3 outputs router circuit.

` 0:1 0:2 1:0 1:2 `

When input pin 0 changes state it will route the new state to outputs 1 and 2.
When input pin 1 changes state it will route to outputs 0 and 2.
