<p>RedstoneChips is a <a href="http://bukkit.org">Bukkit</a> plugin that allows you to build custom integrated redstone
    circuits on your craftbukkit minecraft server. Circuits can be built with any number of inputs and outputs and with any imaginable
    structure. RedstoneChips currently consists of the following plugins:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/downloads/eisental/RedstoneChips/RedstoneChips-0.82.jar"><strong>RedstoneChips-0.82</strong></a> - The core plugin that handles the basics. You must install this plugin to be able to build redstone chips.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/downloads/eisental/BasicCircuits/BasicCircuits-0.82.jar"><strong>BasicCircuits-0.82</strong></a> - The basic circuit library containing many different circuit types.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/downloads/eisental/SensorLibrary/SensorLibrary-0.21.jar"><strong>SensorLibrary-0.21</strong></a> - An optional circuit library for various sensor chips.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="/RedstoneChips/circuitdocs/index.html">circuitdocs</a> for more info. </p>
<p>RedstoneChips and the circuit libraries are currently under heavy development. Don't expect them to work as advertised or at all.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Download the latest craftbukkit release. The current version was tested on build #482. It should work fine on a few previous builds as well.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://github.com/downloads/eisental/RedstoneChips/RedstoneChips-0.82.jar">RedsoneChips 0.82</a> jar file.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://github.com/downloads/eisental/BasicCircuits/BasicCircuits-0.82.jar">BasicCircuits 0.82</a> jar file.</li>
<li>Optionally download the <a href="http://github.com/downloads/eisental/SensorLibrary/SensorLibrary-0.2.jar">SensorLibrary 0.2</a> jar file.</li>

<li>Copy the downloaded jar files into the plugins folder of your craftbukkit installation, keeping their original filenames.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the first time craftbukkit is started with the plugin installed, it will create a folder inside the craftbukkit plugins folder
and a preferences.yml file inside it. The file redstonechip.circuits is created after activating a circuit for the first time and contain all the information required to reactivate the circuits after a server restart.
You can change the block types used to construct a circuit and other settings by editing preferences.yml or preferably, by using the /redchips-prefs command (see <a href="/RedstoneChips/howto.html">how-to</a> for command info).
