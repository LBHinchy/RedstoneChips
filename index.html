<h1>RedstoneChips 0.7</h1>

<p>A Bukkit plugin for building custom integrated redstone circuits with any number of inputs and outputs.
This is the core RedstoneChips plugin consisting of only the essentials.
To actually build ICs you need to download and install the <a href="http://github.com/eisental/BasicCircuits">BasicCircuits</a> plugin.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<ul>
<li>Delete any previously installed jar files.</li>
<li>Rename your <craftbukkit>/plugins/RedstoneChips-XX folder to RedstoneChips-0.6 (or delete it to remove previous settings).</li>
<li>Download <a href="/eisental/RedstoneChips/RedstoneChips-0.6.jar">jar file</a>.</li>
<li>Copy jar file to the plugins folder of your craftbukkit installation.</li>
<li>Install <a href="/eisental/BasicCircuits">BasicCircuits 0.6</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the first time craftbukkit is started with the plugin installed, it will create a folder is inside the craftbukkit plugins folder
and a preferences.yml file. The file redstonechip.dat is created after the activating a circuit for the first time.
You can change the block types used to construct a circuit by editing preferences.yml or by using the /redchips-prefs command (see below).
Default values are gold block for outputs, iron block for inputs, and sandstone for the chip itself.
Type is NOT case-sensitive and can be any bukkit block material name or id.
any already activated circuit will stay activated even after it's block types are no longer valid.</p>

<h2>How to build an IC</h2>

<p>First build a line of chip blocks and add input and output blocks to the left or to the right of the line.
Place a lever on the block next to each output block and a wall sign attached to the first main block of the circuit.
On the first line of text write the circuit class name, any additional arguments must use the next lines.
Once the IC is built, right-click the sign to activate it. You should receive a green confirmation message that lets you know
that the circuit is now ready for use.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any block that can send a redstone current (redstone wire, redstone torch, button or lever) can be placed on the block next to an input.
The direction of a redstone wire is irrelevant as long as its in the right place.</li>
<li>Input and output numbering starts from the sign onwards. i.e. input/output 0 will be the ones closest to the sign.
Blocks south or west to the chip block will have a lower index that the blocks on the other side.</li>
<li>The main line can be of any length and input and output blocks can be placed anywhere along this line, on both sides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example 4-bit counter chip with 2 inputs and 4 outputs (looking from above, each letter represents one block):
* b - main block (sandstone by default) * i - input block (iron block by default) * o - output block (gold block by default) * l - lever on any block face * s - wall sign attached to the main block</p>

<pre><code>       s
0  l o b i  0
       b
1  l o b i  1
       b
2  l o b
       b
3  l o b
</code></pre>

<p>sign text (on first line):
    counter</p>

<p>The first input pin is one line after the sign. Each time the block on its right receives a redstone current the chip will increment
its internal variable by 1 and output it as a binary number by changing the state of the output levers. The least significant bit 
is the first output (i.e. the one closest to the sign). For example, when the counter reaches 5, it will switch on outputs 0 and 2 
giving out the binary number 1010. </p>

<p>The second input pin is the reset pin. When it receives redstone current the counter will go back to 0.</p>

<h2>Destroying an IC</h2>

<p>You can destroy an IC by breaking any of its structure blocks, including the output levers.
Creepers and TNT explosions will also cause the IC to stop functioning.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>/redchips-active</strong> Lists every currently active circuit on the server.</li>
<li><strong>/redchips-classes</strong> Prints a list of installed circuit classes.</li>
<li><strong>/redchips-pin</strong> Get info and identify chip pins. Point your cross at one of the pins and enter the command.</li>
<li><strong>/redchips-debug</strong> Register a player as a debugger for a specific circuit. Point your cross at one of the circuit blocks and enter the command. The plugin will now send you debug messages from this circuit. Enter /redchips-debug off while pointing, to stop debugging.</li>
<li><strong>/redchips-prefs</strong> Prints preferences.</li>
<li><strong>/redchips-prefs key</strong> Prints one preference key: value pair.</li>
<li><strong>/redchips-prefs key value</strong> Changes the value of a preference key and saves the file. Only admins are allowed to change the preferences values.
<ul><li>Example: typing <code>/redchips-prefs chipBlockType GLASS</code> will change the preferences value and make the plugin immediately expect new chips to have their body made of glass.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
